# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## 📋 Overview
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a model to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. By analyzing historical transaction data, the model will identify patterns indicative of fraud, providing a valuable tool for financial institutions to enhance security and prevent fraudulent activities.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
This project uses the following Python libraries and frameworks:
- **PyTorch**: For building and training neural network models.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data

## 🔢 Dataset
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones, making it a challenging problem.
